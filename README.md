# Social Media Performance Analysis - Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend logic for the **Social Media Performance Analysis** project. The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express**. It handles API requests, fetches engagement data from various social media platforms, processes that data, and stores it in **DataStax Astra DB**. Additionally, it integrates with **Langflow** to generate insights from the performance data using machine learning.

## Features

- Connects to **DataStax Astra DB** for storing and fetching social media engagement data.
- Fetches data from social media platforms (Instagram, Twitter, etc.) via API requests.
- Processes engagement data such as likes, shares, and comments.
- Provides insights and detailed performance analytics using **Langflow**.
- Exposes RESTful API endpoints to allow the frontend to fetch the processed data.
- Handles user authentication and session management using **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens).

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend server.
- **Express**: API framework for handling requests.
- **DataStax Astra DB**: Cloud-based database for storing social media engagement data.
